\hfill \parbox{7cm}{\centering There are some important relationships between force, energy, and momentum. Recall that if an unbalanced force is acting on a body, the body will accelerate.} \hfill  \parbox{7cm}{\centering If a force acts on a body for a finite time interval, what would be the difference between a long time interval and a short time interval for the same force?} \hfill \hspace{0cm}

\hfill \parbox{6.5cm}{Newton defined force as the rate of change of momentum. $$F= \frac{\Delta \rho}{\Delta t}$$} \hfill \parbox{7.5cm}{Multiplying by time gives us an interesting way to understand the effect of a force $F$ acting for a time interval $\Delta t$.  $$F \Delta t= \Delta \rho $$} \hfill \mbox{}

\vspace{.75cm}

\hfill \parbox{10cm}{Thus the effect of a force acting for a specific amount of time is a change in momentum.  This quantity is called \emph{impulse} and is given the variable $I$.  It has the same units as momentum. } \hfill \mbox{} $$I =F \Delta t$$

\hfill \parbox{6.5cm}{Consider a body of mass $m$ in a gravitational field.  If the body starts at a height of $h_\circ$ and ends up at a height of $h_f$, \begin{itemize} \item What has changed?  \item Where did that energy come from?  \item What had to happen for the body to move from one place to another? \end{itemize}} \hfill \raisebox{-4cm}{\includegraphics{raisedMass}} \hfill \mbox{}

\hfill \parbox{6.5cm}{The mass on the previous page had to have been acted upon by a force, and we can see that the result was a change in (potential) energy.  A force can also effect a change in kinetic energy, or other kinds of energy.  When this happens, we say that there was \emph{work} done on the mass.  Work has units of energy.} \hfill \parbox{5cm}{$$W = F \cdot d \cos \theta$$ In the above equation, $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the path $d$.  If the force is in the same direction as the motion of the mass, the equation becomes $$W = F \cdot d$$} \hfill \mbox{}

\hfill \parbox{10cm}{Now consider the example of climbing stairs.  If you walk up the stairs, you are changing your potential energy by \emph{doing work}.  What is the difference between running up the stairs and walking slow?  The rate of change of energy (or the rate at which work is done) is called \emph{power}.  Power is represented by the variable $P$ and has units of J/s.} \hfill \mbox{} $$P =\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t} \hspace{2cm} P =\frac{W}{\Delta t}$$
