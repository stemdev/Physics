\item $m_1 = 3 \kg$ smacks into the stationary $m_2 = 5\kg$ at 20 m/s.  If $m_1$ bounces back at 6 m/s, what is the final velocity of $m_2$?  What if $m_1$ comes to rest after hitting $m_2$? \\ \vspace{1cm}

\item $m_1 = 5 \kg$ is traveling at 10 m/s and collides with $m_2 = 5 \kg$ which is at rest.  They stick together.  How fast are they moving? \\ \vspace{1cm}

\item $m_1 = 1 \kg$ collides with $m_2 = 2 \kg$, head-on.  They were both initially traveling at 7 m/s.  If $m_2$ recoils with a speed of 2 m/s, how fast and in what direction is $m_1$ going after the collision? \\ \vspace{1cm}

\item $m_1 = 3 \kg$ collides with $m_2 = 2 \kg$, sending $m_2$ off at an angle of $25^\circ$ with a speed of 5 m/s.  If $m_1$ was initially traveling at 4 m/s, and $m_2$ was initially at rest, how fast and at what angle is $m_1$ going now? \\ \vspace{1cm}

\item For the following picture, what is $v_1, v_2, v_3,$ and $v_4$? (This is a ball rolling on a track, and there is no friction)  \\ \vspace{1cm}
